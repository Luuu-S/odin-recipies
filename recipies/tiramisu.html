    <h2> Decription</h2>
    <p> <strong>STEP 1</strong>
        Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.
        </p>
     <p> <strong> STEP 2</strong> 
        Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.
    </p>  
      <p> <strong> STEP 3</strong> 
        Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until youâ€™ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.
    </p> 
     <p><strong> STEP 4</strong> 
        Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.
    </p>    
      <p><strong> STEP 5</strong> 
        Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.
    </p>  
       <p><strong> STEP 6</strong> 
        To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</p>
